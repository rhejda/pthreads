Coding with Threads in C

PThreads is a library in C that allows us to create user threads. 

Included in this repository are some examples of how to properly use pthreads.

Why Threads?
Threads are a light weight process. Threads share the same memory image as their parent process.
Threads can use global variables declared in the parent to signal eachother for fast communication.
